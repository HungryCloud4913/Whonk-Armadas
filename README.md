#Whonk Armadas 

##The whonk armadas are a collection of 20 massive fleets of interplanetary spacecraft. They roam around the galaxy, industrializing and depleting planets of resources and then using them to construct more ships to add to their fleet.
One of the whonk armadas are present in the solar system Mindustry is set in, and thus must be eliminated. This will not be a easy task as half the system has already been industrialized, so you will have to take back the planets Cretelus, Drestari and Vreteis.
